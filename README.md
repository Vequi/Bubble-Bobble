## Description

Bubble Bobble is a platformer where players control two bubble-blowing dragons named Bub and Bob. The objective is simple, players go through single-screen levels, trapping enemies in bubbles and then popping them to progress. Bubble Bobble has unique gameplay mechanics, but it shares similarities with classic arcade titles such as Mario Bros, BurgerTime, and Mr Do!

Bubble Bobble's success in the arcade market was remarkable, with the approval from both players and critics alike, being the 5th best-selling game in Japan in 1986. Its popularity led to various ports and adaptations for home consoles and computer systems. The game's success is evident, and it is reflected in its inclusion in numerous “Best of” lists of arcade gaming.
